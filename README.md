## **SQL ‚Äì Data Extraction & Transformation**  
- Wrote SQL queries to extract and clean manufacturing operations data.  
- Applied joins, aggregations, and window functions for deeper insights.  
- Key queries included:  
  - Finding second highest production output.  
  - Identifying top-performing plants and production lines.  
  - Downtime and defect tracking.  
- Optimized queries for performance and created reusable scripts.  

---

## **Excel ‚Äì Dashboard & Data Analysis**  
- Cleaned raw production data using Excel formulas and functions.  
- Built **pivot tables and charts** to track manufacturing KPIs.  
- Designed an **Excel dashboard** with slicers for plant, machine, and time-period selection.  
- **Key visuals included:**  
  - Top 10 machines by efficiency  
  - Plant-wise production output  
  - Defect and downtime analysis  

---

## **Power BI ‚Äì Interactive Dashboard**  
- Built a **Power BI dashboard** for real-time production monitoring.  
- Used **DAX measures** to calculate KPIs like OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), downtime %, and defect ratio.  
- Added **interactive slicers and filters** for plant, line, and time.  
- **Key visuals included:**  
  - Production trend over time  
  - Best performing lines/plants  
  - Downtime and maintenance insights  
- Used drill-through and tooltips for deeper analysis.  

---

## **Tableau ‚Äì Visual Storytelling**  
- Designed a **Tableau dashboard** for high-level storytelling and KPI monitoring.  
- Created interactive visuals to highlight:  
  - Output by plant and line  
  - Defect and downtime patterns  
  - Production trend analysis  
- Used parameters and filters for flexible, user-driven insights.
